Hello! I'm a Senior Full-Stack Engineer, mainly focused on tech like:

* NodeJS / JavaScript / TypeScript ❤️
* React / Recoil
* Tailwind CSS
* Python / NLP / Tensorflow
* MySQL / Postgresql / MongoDB / Redis / Firebase
* Java / LibGDX

I also have some side projects that I do on my free time. Including a Chrome Extension with 1,000+ users.

And a few times per year I paint.
